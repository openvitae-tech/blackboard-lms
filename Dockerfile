# Run and own only the runtime files as a non-root user for security
## Note:
## Docker allows non root used to bind to port 80 and it works perfectly.
## But tried this in AWS ECS, the application cannot bind to port 80
## as non root user therefore commenting our the user creation.
## Tried a work aroud by using port 3000 but the load balancer health check
## requires port 80 in aws, therefore port 80 seems like a mandatory requirement.
